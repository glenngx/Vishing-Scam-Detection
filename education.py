        1. **Urgency and fear tactics**: \n
        Scammers will utilize threats to induce a feeling of urgency in order to push you into taking quick action. 
        If you receive a call like this, stay composed and do not provide any payment or personal details.
    
        2. **Background noise or poor audio quality**: \n
        Loud ambient sounds or inferior audio clarity.

        Be alert for unusual background noise or low-quality audio during phone conversations. 
        Additionally, pay attention to voices that sound unnatural or robotic, as they may indicate a robocall.
                    
        3. **Immediate Payment**: \n
        A telltale sign is if the caller warns of consequences if money is not transfered immediately.
                    
        4. **Personal Information Inquiry**: \n
        You should start to be suspicious if the caller claims to be a government official or from a legitimate source and
        requests for your bank details and personal information such as NRIC. 
                    
        5. **Keep it to yourself**: \n
                    
        You are advised not to share the call with anyone.
        This is done to discourage you from finding help and identify the call as a vishing scam.
                    
        6. **Caller number with the "+" prefix**: \n
        When you see a number that appears to be local but has a "+" at the beginning, it is probably

        Fake phone call. The prefix "+" sign is only used for incoming international calls.

        Local calls will not include a "+" prefix in the display.
